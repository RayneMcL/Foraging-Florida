            <p class="head">How to not get Arrested</p>
            <p class="content">Before you embark on your first foraging adventure, it is good to understand a few things about the proper procedures. Like most activiteies, even one as timeless as foraging has laws that must be abidded. These laws on foraging mainly center around the gathering of threatened/endangered/commercially exploited plants (list found <a href="https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Protect-Our-Environment/Botany/Florida-s-Endangered-Plants/Endangered-Threatened-and-Commercially-Exploited-Plants-of-Florida" target="_blank">here</a> along with general info on the matter) and procedures of foraging on federal lands. If anything you wish to gather is found in that list then it is best to see what of the three categories it falls under. If it falls under endangered or is a comercially exploited plant then you will need a permit but if it is a threatened plant then al you need is permission from the land owner the plant is found on. Regardless of whatever you are looking for, if it is on land owned by someone then you need to inform the land owner and make sure what you are doing is allowed. this is to insure safety of yourself, the environment, and to overall avoid trouble with authorities. Also don't think about gathering at natural parks/conservation areas/nature reserves.</p>

            <p class="head">Foraging Ethics</p>
            <p class="content">A good way to look at foraging is to think of it like you are taking food from a friends pantry. You take with consideration of others. Essentially don't be a slob, follow the <strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> only gather 1/3 and no more of the plants available at a certain locale or 1/3 of the plant/berries of a tree. This is to avoid over-harvesting which that alone can cause the endangerment of plants and overall makes it harder for plants to repopulate the areas they are harvested from. <br>
            be as gentle as you can when foraging an area and try to avoid any unnecessary damage by not rippping at plants or trampling them. Also, it is good to recognize and understand which plants are native and which aren't. By doing this you can understand which plants might be invasive and you can minimize their spread by avoiding the plants altogether or by carefully securing and isolating any seeds from the plant. <br> 
            Lastly, wash your gathered goods, and thoroughly wash any goods that were gathered close to the ground as it may contain urine or fecal matter from wild animals. Using commercial produce cleaner, vinegar solution, or a simple swish bath with clean water will do the trick. </p>

            <p class="head">Florida Climate and the challenge it brings to Foraging</p>
            <p class="content">The climate and geography make Florida a difficult place to forage compared to most places northward but the difficulty is a helpful challenge because if you can learn to forage in Florida, then you can practically forge anywhere. To lay out the basics, most foraged goods found in Florida look drastically different compared to variations found up north in cooler climates. Florida in itself possesses a temperarate to tropical to swampy climates and with the seasonal changes accounted for, the foraging scene changes constantly with types of plants appearing in climates they don't seem native to. The best way to familiarize yourself with these changes is to start learning what all is available each season in the locations you wish to forage. A good way to learn efficently and gain some experience while learning is to ask around locals and wildlife experts in the area to better understand where you want to forage, and the best ways to go about it for that area. </p>

            <p class="head">A Brief History of Foraging</p>
            <p class="content">Way back when, before we humans figured out agriculture, we were simple hunter gatherers and we relied off the land to provide food. In a sense, foraging has been around for as long as we have been. Starting out I doubt we knew everything about what was good to eat and what wasn't or proper procedures and all that but people learned and ended developing substantial lives based around foraging. These groups dependent on hunting/gathering lifestyles continued up until 500 years ago with scant few groups of people that solely rely upon this method. Lately however, there has been a surge in foraging as people wish to reconnect with nature and explore its various bounties, rid local envirinments of invasive plants, and possibly save some money on food.  </p>
