        <p class="head">Cabbage Palm (Sabal Palmetto)</p>
        <p class="content">Cabbage Palms or better yet Sabal Palmettos can be found all over Florida and you probably have come across these palms coutless times without realizing it. These palms get the Cabbage part of their names from a certain point right above the trunk and it is known as the terminal bud and when consumed it tastes like cabbage or artichoke. Now the one issue involved with gathering these palms is that when gathering the terminal bud, it practically kills the tree as the terminal bud is the source in which the rest of the plant grows from. Essentially you would be killing the palm so if you decide to take a crack at this then make sure you are on private labd and/or have authorization to remove the palm. Overall this is one of the more difficult options to gather compared to others here. <br>*Side-note: younger leaves of the palm can be used as material for brushes* </p>

        <p class="head">Cattails (Typha)</p>
        <p class="content">Im sure all who are reading have seen one of these corn dog looking plants around some body of water or in some sort of media but do you know how edible this plant really is? In terms of edibility, the whole plant can be eaten. Before you go chowing down on the corn dog plant, make sure the area you find it in isnt polluted, located on a roadside, agriculture area or dairy farm, and the plant itself looks relatively young and clean of any imperfections or signs of disease. Once that is determined and you find yourself a good cattail, grab the inner part of the plant and get ready to use some elbow grease because you're going to have to yank it out. In terms of prep, younger stems can be eaten raw or boiled. Before the plant flowers, the inside bits of the shoots can be cooked or eaten raw once squeezed out. The rhizomes (main root that grows horizontally) can be processed into flour with protein content close to rice or maize(corn) (harvested from late autumn to early spring). Smaller shoots that originate from the rhizome can be eaten both raw and cooked. Underground, the plant posseses a carbohydrate clump whch is similar to a potato as it can be peeled and has both good qualities either cooked or raw. Moving on, the rind of the stems can be peeled off to reveal an edible tender heart that can be boiled or eaten raw and has similar qualities to asparagus. Once early summer hits, the sheath that is around the developing green flower spike can be removed, and once boiled it can be eaten like corn on the cob. Lastly its collected pollen can be used as a flour supplement/thickener. </p>

        <p class="head">Cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco)</p>
        <p class="content">This shrub/bushy tree can be found near beaches and possess opal shaped and almost leathery leaves that range from a green to a light reddish color with white specks scattered across the leaf. The shrub also produces a small fruit known as a drupe that and its colors can range from a paleish to a rosey color to a deep purple. The fruit possesses a stone-like seed that can be ground down into a spice powder that is part of a West African soup mix. The fruit itself possesses mildly sweet to almost tasteless flavor and can be used for jam. Lastly the leaves of this plant can apparently be used to treat high blood sugar levels.</p>

        <p class="head">Elderberry (Sambucus canadensis)</p>
        <p class="content">Growing from a small shrub, Elderberries can be found. Among all foragable berries, Elderberries are probably the most recognizable due to them being found all over the world. Here in Florida they can appear more shriveled then in other parts of the world. It's good to know that all parts of this plant are inedible and posess some form of toxicity except for the berry and flower. With that in mind, is is neccesary to avoid unripe fruits and seeds when consuming elderberries as they are very toxic. Most common ways of consuming elderberries is via jams, jellies, and syrups. These processes involve cooking down the berry and straining out any seeds. Drinks can also be made by soaking the flower heads in water for around eight hour. Wine, jelly, and dye are other products that come from elderberry fruit. On the other hand, insecticide and more dye can be produced from the leaves and inner bark of the shrub. The leaves can also be used topically in herbalism. </p>

        <p class="head">Papaya (Carica Papaya)</p>
        <p class="content">Papaya comes from a small tree that grows upwards of 5 to 10 meters tall and contains scarring near the lower trunk where leaves and fruit previously grew. These fruits can be eaten unripened but need to be cooked due to latex it contains. you can also sautee or pikcle unripe Papayas. In some places Papayas are eaten raw while ripened, with the seeds and skin removed. If you needed to ripen a fruit a little more for consumption then you can leave it in the sun. Younger Papaya leaves can be steamed and act as a substitute for spinach. <br> *Papayas are also used for medical purposes as they have been useful in treating Malaria and can act as an abortifacient, a purgative, and can apparently when smoked relieve asthma </p>
