            <li class="content">If an animal eats something, it does not mean it is safe</li>
            <li class="content">don't eat any nuts that smell like almonds</li>
            <li class="content">When looking for mushrooms remember that generally if the insides are black then you should avoid it but if the insides are white then it is generally edible but do make sure know for sure what species you are eating before you do so as that rule doesn't really apply to certain species</li>
            <li class="content">Single fruits on a stem are usually good to eat (save for any imperfections/problems the individual fruit might posess at the time, infection, bugs, etc.)</li>

        <p class="head">Method for Testing Wild Berries & Fruits:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="content">Put a small amount of juice from the good in question on your arm and wait until it dries and take note of any swelling, burning, or redness and if there is none then go on to the next step.</li>
            <li class="content">Put a dab of the juice in your mouth until it is dried and if there is no burning or stinging then you can head on to the next step.</li>
            <li class="content">Put a dab of the fruit/berry on your tongue and if there is no stinging or burning then you can move on down the list.</li>
            <li class="content">Eat a tiny amount and look out for any sickness, nausea and/or vomit. If you exprience any of those symptoms then stop eating! If no symptoms occur in 24 hours that you may continue.</li>
            <li class="content">Regardless on how safe the berries/fruits are and if everything checks out, you should still be very reserved in consuming the goods until you are 100% certain if you are recieving any symptoms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="content"><br>*Side Note: many plants contain compounds that mask many of the symptoms that you look out for or have symptoms like emetics and/or laxatives.*</p>
